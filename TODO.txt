Create launch file for VSLAM on orin nano and maybe laptop

Note that you mounted SSD to /ssd not what isaac_ros tutorial says... changet file path in .bashrc 

Had the run the following on orin to get isaac ros to work... also didn't follow isaac_ros tutorial followed the one on the getting started website: sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --mode=csv --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml

clone VIO-UAV repo to ISAACROS workspace/src !!!

USE -b 3.2 for isaac_ros2 branch

The following is what my .bashrc looks like (note change path for issac-sim):

# Add ISSAC ROS workspace path
export ISAAC_ROS_WS=/home/bandofpv/isaac_ros-dev/

# Isaac Sim root directory
export ISAACSIM_PATH="${HOME}/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac-sim-4.2.0"

# Isaac Sim python executable
alias ISAACSIM_PYTHON="${ISAACSIM_PATH}/python.sh"

# Isaac Sim app
alias ISAACSIM="${ISAACSIM_PATH}/isaac-sim.sh"

export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp
export ROS_DISTRO=humble
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1

# Can only be set once per terminal.
# Setting this command multiple times will append the internal library path again potentially leading to conflicts
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ISAACSIM_PATH/exts/omni.isaac.ros2_bridge/humble/lib


NOTES: Re add GPS() to self.sensors list extensions/pegasus.simulator/pegasus/simulator/logic/vehicles/multirotor.py
       The /home/sim/ros2_ws/install/mavros/share/mavros/launch/px4_config.yaml file parameter fake gps vision is set to true
       Look into /clock and setting use_sim_time to true????
       Use default run scripts for issac ros vslam --> make sure domain id is set to 1???


Made changes to extensions/pegasus.simulator/pegasus/simulator/params.py --> add Iris VIO
