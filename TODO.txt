Create launch file for VSLAM on orin nano and maybe laptop

Note that you mounted SSD to /ssd not what isaac_ros tutorial says... changet file path in .bashrc 

Had the run the following on orin to get isaac ros to work... also didn't follow isaac_ros tutorial followed the one on the getting started website: sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --mode=csv --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml
